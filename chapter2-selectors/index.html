        The Content-Type header is sent by your web server (or web browser if
        you use the file upload interface) and depends on its configuration.
        Commonly, web servers will have a mapping of <span class ="highlight">filename extensions (such
          as ".html")</span>to MIME Content-Type values (such as text/html).

        That you received this message can mean that your server is not
        configured correctly, that your file does not have the correct filename
        extension, or that you are attempting to validate a file type that we do
        not support yet. In the latter case you should let us know that you need
        us to support that content type please include all relevant details,
